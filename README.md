## 📖 Background

Many Korean international students in the U.S. face challenges when navigating American pharmacies because:

- Medication brand names differ significantly from Korean products  
- Active ingredients are unfamiliar  
- It is difficult to confidently match Korean medicines to U.S. equivalents  

MedLink addresses this challenge by providing structured symptom-based recommendations and Korean-to-U.S. medication mapping in a clean, intuitive interface.

## 🧠 Development Note

I leveraged Claude as an AI coding assistant to accelerate prototyping and development.

I was responsible for:

- Product concept development  
- System architecture design  
- Feature implementation  
- UI/UX design decisions  
- Testing and debugging  

Claude was used strictly as a development tool, while overall system logic and product direction were independently designed and validated.

Healthcare-related software carries ethical responsibility. MedLink prioritizes clarity, transparency, and responsible communication to avoid misleading users.
